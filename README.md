Parse English language sentences to find the nouns and verbs

# parenlang.py
Initial work based on [this blog post](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/get-nouns-verbs-noun-and-verb-phrases-6a378259084).

# noungrabber.py
Is a much more focussed attempt than `parenlang.py` and outputs only nouns. The initial version is based on [this Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58148828/364088).
