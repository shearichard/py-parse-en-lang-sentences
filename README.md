# parenlang.py
Initial work based on [this blog post](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/get-nouns-verbs-noun-and-verb-phrases-6a378259084).

# noungrabber.py
Is a much more focussed attempt than `parenlang.py` and outputs only nouns. The initial version is based on [this Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58148828/364088).

# textblobtester.py
Uses textblob library to find parts of speech. Useful reference for that is https://pythonprogramming.net/part-of-speech-tagging-nltk-tutorial/. A table showing the significance of the parts of speech tabs is here : https://cs.nyu.edu/~grishman/jet/guide/PennPOS.html .
